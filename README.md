FlavorOfTheDay
==============

A Twilio-powered PHP script for use with Culvers Flavor of the Day schedules.

Coming soon
-----------
+Support for multiple store locations.  The user can text "Verona" to get the Flavor of the Day at the Verona store, and "Madison" to get that store's flavor.
+A powerful, user-friendly backend.  Right now you have to edit the PHP script itself in order to change flavors.  I want this to be something that can easily be changed by Culvers employees.
+Support for multiple months.  Culvers publishes their flavor schedules about a week before the month ends.  I want to be able to add that schedule as soon as it comes out without compromising the current month's schedule.
